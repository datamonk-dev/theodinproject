Welcome Monk!

It's great to have you with us while you learn engineering the hard way and the best way !  It can be a bit overwhelming at first, so to get you started here are a few tips:


1: Plan out your strategy

Figure out how much time each week you'll be able to devote to learning then browse through our roadmap of courses and plan your strategy accordingly.  The biggest issue students have is getting distracted (especially since we link to so much juicy content), so staying focused is important.
Have a look at the curriculum at <%= paths_url %>


2: Dive into your first course

Get started! If you're brand spanking new to all this, start with <%= link_to "Foundations", path_url("foundations") %>.
Otherwise start whatever <%= link_to "course", paths_url %> that interests you the most.

3: Get help and work with others

We have a Discord server that you can join by visiting https://datamonk-internship.slack.com.


4: Tell your friends!

If you find the project helpful, please spread the word.  It's always more fun to learn with friends :)


If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to rgupta.datamonk@gmail.com


Best of luck with your learning journey!

Sincerely,

Rahul Gupta
Founder, Datamonk
